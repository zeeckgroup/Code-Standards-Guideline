# Coding Standards for Flutter Application Development

## Introduction

This document delineates the coding standards, conventions, and best practices tailored for Flutter application development within [Zeeck Digital Concept LTD](https://zeeckgroup.com/). Adherence to these guidelines ensures uniformity, readability, and maintainability across all Flutter projects.

## File and Folder Structure

### File Naming

- Use descriptive names conveying the file's purpose.
- Employ **lowercase** and **snake_case** for Dart source files. Example: `main.dart`, `data_manager.dart`, `api_service.dart`.
- Utilize PascalCase for class names. Example: `UserService`, `ProductModel`.

### Folder Structure

Organize folders by functionality or feature.
Recommended structure:

```
lib/
â”œâ”€â”€ models/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ user.dart
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ product.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ services/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ api_service.dart
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ data_manager.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ views/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ home_screen.dart
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ profile_screen.dart
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ widgets/
â”‚ â”œâ”€â”€ custom_button.dart
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ product_tile.dart
â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”‚ â””â”€â”€ constants.dart
â””â”€â”€ main.dart
```

## Coding Style

### Naming Conventions

- **Class Naming**: Employ descriptive PascalCase names for classes. Example: `UserService`, `ProductModel`.
- **Function Naming**: Utilize camelCase for function names. Example: `getUserById()`, `calculateTotalPrice()`.
- **Variable Naming**: Use camelCase for variables. Example: `userName`, `totalAmount`.
- **Constants**: Apply uppercase snake_case for constants. Example: `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`.

### Formatting and Indentation

- Use 4 spaces for indentation in Dart files.
- Adhere to Dart formatting conventions.
- Maintain consistent line length (80-120 characters) for enhanced readability.
- Include spaces around operators and after commas.

```dart
// Example of formatting and indentation in Dart

/// Generates a greeting message for the user.
///
/// Takes [name] as input and returns a greeting message.
///
/// @param name The name of the user to greet.
/// @return A string containing the greeting message.
String greetUser(String name) {
  return 'Hello, $name!';
}

```

## Documentation and Comments

- Employ DartDoc for documenting classes, methods, and functions.
- Add comments to elucidate complex logic, algorithms, or critical business rules.
- Clearly document function parameters, return types, and descriptions.

```dart
/// Function to calculate the discounted price.
///
/// [originalPrice]: The original price of the product.
/// [discountPercentage]: The percentage of discount to be applied.
///
/// Returns the discounted price.
double calculateDiscount(double originalPrice, double discountPercentage) {
// Logic for calculating discount
}
```

## State Management

- Leverage Flutter's state management techniques like Provider, Bloc, or Riverpod based on project complexity and requirements.
- Embrace a single-source-of-truth principle to efficiently manage application state.
- Minimize unnecessary state changes and updates for optimal performance.

## Error Handling

- Always handle exceptions and errors gracefully.
- Use try-catch blocks to catch exceptions and handle errors appropriately.
- Throw custom exceptions for specific error cases to ensure comprehensible error messages.

```dart
/// Function to fetch user data from an API.
///
/// Throws a [UserNotFoundException] if the user does not exist.
User getUserById(int userId) {
try {
// Logic to fetch user data
} catch (e) {
throw UserNotFoundException('User with ID $userId not found');
}
}
```

## Testing

- Author unit tests for Dart functions and widgets using the Flutter test framework.
- Employ widget tests to examine UI components and their interactions.
- Organize test files within dedicated folders for systematic management.

## Performance Optimization

- Optimize UI performance by reducing unnecessary widget rebuilds.
- Utilize widgets judiciously, minimize nesting, and leverage Flutter's widget lifecycle methods.
- Use const constructors for immutable widgets wherever feasible to curtail rebuilds.
